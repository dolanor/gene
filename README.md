# gene [![go.dev reference](https://img.shields.io/badge/go.dev-reference-007d9c?logo=go&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/dolanor/gene)

Generics utilities to reduce some simple boilerplate.
(for now, reduced to cloning maps and slices)

## Slices

```go
clone := slices.Clone(whateverSlice)
```

## Maps

```go
clone := maps.Clone(whateverMaps)
```
